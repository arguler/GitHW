/*
For you to do:
**In Method Class:**
Complete static sum2D method by writing an accumulator algorithm that
will calculate the sum of all the element in the 2D array passed as a parameter.
You know how to do this. You know how to do an accumulator algorithm
with a 1-D array. Now it's "loop through all the elements of the 2-D array"
instead of "loop through all the elements of the 1-D array".
You know how to loop through a 2-D array.  You got this.
**In Main Class:**
Create relation between Main class and Method by making Main class
as a subclass of the Method Class
Use Array:
int[][] a = { { 1, 2, 3 },
              { 4, 5, 6 },
              { 7, 8, 9 } };
and execute sum2D method
**Expected Output:**
45
